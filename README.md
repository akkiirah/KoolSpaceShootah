#  Kool Space Shootah

## Information

Just a generic space shooter where I tried to make everything myself.
I used the [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/) Framework for this project due to it beeing
great to learn programming with.
Also it's fun and challenging to do almost everything by yourself.
