#  Kool Space Shootah

## Information

Just a generic space shooter where I tried to make everything myself.<br />
I used the [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/) Framework for this project due to it beeing
great to learn programming with.<br />
Also it's fun and challenging to do almost everything by yourself.
